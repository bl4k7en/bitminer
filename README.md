Bitminer is a minimalist, idle clicker game where you mine digital "Bits" by clicking, hire automated workers, and upgrade your mining operation.
The core loop involves progressing through ranks, achieving milestones, and performing "Ascensions" to gain permanent bonuses for faster progress in new games.

Recent Updates (v1.1 & v1.2):
v1.2: Introduced mineable "Rare Bits," rebalanced clicker skins with bonuses, fixed achievements and the Import/Export function. (Note: A new game is advised for this update).

v1.1: Added the achievement and rank system, visual themes with background animations, and a working Import/Export save system.



Core Gameplay & Features:
Click to Mine: Manually collect Bits with satisfying visual feedback.

Automation: Hire workers to generate passive income.

Progression: Ascend for permanent boosts and climb the ranks.

Achievements: Unlock 45 achievements to earn multiplier rewards.


Technical Details:
Built with pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
